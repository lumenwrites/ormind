Welcome to WP-Starter
====================
WP-Starter is child theme for [WP-Forge] (https://github.com/tsquez/WP-Forge). I have included all the files for you in the event that you need to add something or change something. This way you do not touch any of the main files in WP-Forge. For more information on child themes you can visit the [WordPress Codex] (http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes).

###WP-Starter Demo###
You can see a demo of WP-Forge here: http://wpstarter.themeawesome.com - Make sure you look at the source of the site so you can see that the demo is in fact running the child theme.

###PressTrends###
Added [PressTrends] (http://presstrends.io/) analytics service to track the usage of WP-Starter. The sole purpose of including this in WP-Starter is to help me improve the theme overall. If you do not wish to be tracked you can comment line 41 of the functions.php file.

###WP-Starter Forums###
If you need help with implementation or if you run into issues, you can post your questions/issues here or visit the forums: http://themeawesome.com/forums
